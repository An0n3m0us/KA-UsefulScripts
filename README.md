# Khan Academy - Useful Scripts

A collection of scripts made for use on Khan Academy.

#### processDiscussionRedirects.js

Gets the origin project of each transcript video and project within a CS unit page. \
This is useful for redirecting discussion questions to the correct location as links (as of 2021/01/03) are broken. \
To process the data, visit any unit on the CS platform (for example: Intro to JS) and run the script in the console. \
A dictionary containing the redirects will be printed onto the console once the process is complete.

Credit to [Element118](https://github.com/Element118) for finding this issue and assisting in the idea of the redirect links.
